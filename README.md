# üè¢ Acquire <!-- Project Description -->
An original rendition based on the game Acquire from Stuck-Between-Pixels. From boardgamegeek.com, "In Acquire, each player 
strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock. As the businesses grow with tile placements, they 
also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest 
into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade 
them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth." The goal of this 
project is to gain experience working on a team with more roles than people and with less time than is needed for the individual 
parts to get done (like in the real world). This will need to be done so that a well-built and functioning system is created. 
It is also to implement and gain experience with design patterns and OO principles. We are also going to gain familiarity 
with tools such as git, Gradle, UML, GSON, etc. Overall, we are going to gain experience in delivering a finished product 
to a customer that fits their requirements. These requirements include: At least two people can play the game which includes 
correctly processing a player's turn, correctly handling merges, and correctly handling stocks and banking. Most of the original 
game logic must be implemented. Must be able to be saved to a file and loaded from a file at runtime. Must have a GUI and the 
underlying system must have a minimum of 3 separate instances of design patterns as discussed in class.

# Install <!-- How to install -->
Before installing this project, you must have both Java and Gradle installed on your local system. To install, clone this 
repository to your computer. To run, you first must make sure that you are in the directory that you just cloned. Then, on 
the command line enter the following text: `gradle run`

# üöÄ Usage <!-- How to use the project -->
Once the game is up and running, you will have the option to either select a file to load a previous game from, or you will 
have the option to create a new game. Once the game begins, each player will be given $6000 and six tiles to be placed on the 
board. A player's turn begins with them placing a tile and ends when they draw a new tile. A player will have the option to 
buy up to three shares of any existing corporation during their turn. A player can declare the game end when a corporation has 
41 or more tiles, or if all corporations on the board are safe. For a more in-depth look at the rules visit: [Acquire Rules](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/acquire/game-rules.php)

# Run tests <!-- How to run tests -->
To run the tests, simply move into the test file for the respective class or method that you want to test. (Note that 100% test
coverage is nearly impossible so not all methods will have a test). Once you have moved into the file, you can run the file
either from the command line or by using the run function in your preferred IDE. The test file will then run and will output
the different tests and their results.
